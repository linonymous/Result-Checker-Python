# Result-Checker-Python

    This is a python based application. Our college results are generally announced on our college website. I used to check the page almost for 50-60 times a day. Then, I just created a random python script. Which runs after a particular period of time and check whether the results are announced or not. If the application found the results on our college page then it produces a beep sound for one second. I used urllib library to fetch data from the web page. There are two files in the application. Timer File calls the check() function in CheckResult after a particular period of time. Its Simple! Its Python!
