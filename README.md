# Result-Checker-Python

This script checks the college website and makes a beep sound as soon the result goes out. College results are not announced at the correct time, so it reduces efforts for going and checking the website again and again. If the application found the results on our college page then it produces a beep sound for a second. Timer File calls the check() function in CheckResult after a specific period of time. Its Simple! Its Python!
